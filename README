# Dotfiles
## Configs
Currently has configuration for:
- zsh
- nvim
## Installation
1. Clone repo into ~
2. Enter repo
3. Install gnu stow
4. Backup existing configuration
5. Execute stow . in repository
## Todo
- zsh currently uses unmaintained zsh4humans which is incomplete and fetches unverified remote script (see .zshenv) which is potentially unsafe
